# isaacsim-dataset-generator
This repository provides tools to generate diverse synthetic datasets using NVIDIA Isaac Sim. The datasets include:
	•	Multiple environments (e.g., warehouses, outdoor scenes)
	•	Various objects and agents (robots, humans, forklifts, drones, etc.)
	•	A wide range of trajectories and behaviors

The generated data is intended for machine learning research in robotics, including training and evaluation of AI-based robotic agents under varied and realistic conditions.
